                It seems as if something is not right. No way for the single individual to reach people. For instance: what if some random person was chosen by Jesus to be visited? Jesus leaves and that one person is left wordless. No photos satisfy because of photoshop and people would throw him in a mental hospital. Everyone's constantly onto the next thing. Even if we reach out and try to find out, we are lied to and fed scripts. All people right now are over-flooded with the information. Did you watch this year's Democratic Debate? That wasn't a debate! That was legit giving the American People more stupid shit to argue about. But at least now we have more facts and can sound smarter. But really- isn't there just ONE government? If we know that one the short term, having a strong Democratic leader shifts the stance in society more Republican and vice versa... Couldn't we say it just depends on how the Government wants to influence the next generation? That may seem far-fetched, but these are the same people who dressed up as aliens to mentally stress out one guy. They know Social and Psychological Behaviors better than anyone else. So... Why are we all so angry and unhappy?       The Common well-being is not being protected by producers of our food and clothing. Doctors aren't even ALLOWED to talk about diet or nutrition when it comes to your health because they will be sued by the food industry which means to murder us all. What The Health discusses WHO and the nutrition side. Did you know cigarettes have carcinogens? How about chicken?
