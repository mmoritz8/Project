                Hospitals are all guilty not reporting shit doctors (psychopaths included, not just the idiots) due to concerns on their reputation. They pass them around rather than report them because they're too damn worried about how much attention it would bring them. Listen to Dr. Death for that horrifying story.       Doctors are not told if medical devices are tested before they actively provide them to people. Nor do most doctors know that companies do NOT look into long-term effects of these products. In their short-term checks with the experimental patients there are reports of them lying to get a product passed! The medical device industry does not have to verify if it even works or is safe to the human body to produce it and tell doctors to sell it and give them bonuses for selling it. Stink is a great Netflix documentary on this topic. Think about it: these are people who need surgeries for back pain, chronic suffering and health emergencies that could mean life or death.       There are no psychological counselors in any hospitals DESPITE years of studies proving emotional health to directly impact your physical health. Stress kills. Truly. Apparently it's the cause behind the aging our skin. In a small child, too much stress can lead to cell-death. Don't get me wrong: stress in healthy doses actually leads to excellence- but toxic amounts will trigger death in kids because the environment is not suitable for survival.
